# Neuromorphic Simulator 🧠⚡

A real-time visual simulator of spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by neuromorphic computing systems like Intel Loihi and IBM TrueNorth.

## 🌟 Features
- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron simulation
- Interactive spike propagation across a custom network
- Synaptic learning via STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity)
- Visual metrics: spike count, latency, weight updates
- React + TypeScript frontend with animated neuron graph

## 📦 Tech Stack
- React, TypeScript, D3 / react-force-graph
- Custom simulation engine (no ML libraries)

## 📸 Preview
